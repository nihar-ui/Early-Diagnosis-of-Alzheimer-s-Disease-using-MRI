# Early-Diagnosis-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease-using-MRI

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, ongoing brain
disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills
and, eventually, affects the ability to carry out simple tasks. Early diagnosis of the disease will help in achieving
treatment with maximum efficiency and a good chance of
recovery. AD is detected using magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), a medical imaging technique. Deep neural networks
play an important role in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by interpreting MRI images.

Early detection is essential for the mighty control of
Alzheimer's disease. Deep neural networks play an
important role in the diagnosis by interpreting MRI
images. Here we have used two different deep neural
network classifiers for classifying a dataset of brain
MRIs into four classes, which are Mild Demented,Moderate Demented, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Demented. We attained an accuracy of
about 50-60% by implementing a feed-forward neural
network model with two hidden layers and accuracy
of 60-70% with a convolutional Neural network model.
